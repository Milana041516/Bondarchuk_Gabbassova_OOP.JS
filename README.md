![The Secret Life of Pets Banner](images/readme-banner.jpg)

## Overview
This project is an **interactive web experience** inspired by *The Secret Life of Pets* TV show and movies. The website introduces users to the beloved pets from the franchise and their owners.

Using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles and **Parcel.js** for bundling, this project dynamically showcases each pet's details. When users click on a pet’s image, additional information about both the **pet** and their **owner** is revealed.
